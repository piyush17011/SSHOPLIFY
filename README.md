an e-commerce website for sneaker heads built using MERN stack                                                                                                                                    
For setup create an `.env` file defining `MONGO_URL` (Mongo connection string) and `JWT_SECRET` (token signing key) inside the backend folder. 
You can copy `backend/env.example` as a starting point. Run `npm install` in both frontend and backend folders.
